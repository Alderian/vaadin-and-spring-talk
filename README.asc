= Vaadin and Spring 

It's been a long day, but you've done it: you've got a Spring Boot powered backend and now you need to build the UI that'll power the workforce and deliver next week. Vaadin, a UI framework that marries the ease of use of server-side Java and the rich, dynamic nature of client-side JavaScript, integrates well with Spring Boot and offers UI polish that would be hard to get any other way. Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long and Vaadin engineer and expert Peter Lehto for a look at building "Bootiful" Vaadin applications with Spring.
